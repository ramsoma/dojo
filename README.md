/tictactoe: Tic-Tac-Toe with Q-Learning Bots and LLM Personalities
This project presents an engaging take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring AI opponents trained using Q-learning for optimal gameplay and imbued with unique personalities powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

  ### Features
    Q-Learning AI Opponents: Play against intelligent bots that have learned optimal strategies through reinforcement learning, making them challenging opponents.
    LLM-Powered Personalities: Each bot possesses a distinct personality, allowing for more dynamic and entertaining interactions during gameplay.
    Interactive Gameplay: A user-friendly interface to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI.
    Modular Design: The project is structured to easily allow for the addition of new bot personalities and refinement of AI training.
  
  ### Technologies Used
    Python: The core programming language for the game logic, Q-learning implementation, and LLM integration.
    (You'll want to add specific libraries here, e.g., NumPy for Q-learning, transformers or specific LLM API client for personality generation, pygame for GUI if applicable.)
    NumPy: For numerical operations, especially crucial for handling Q-tables.
    Openai API: For integrating Large Language Models to generate bot personalities and dialogue.
